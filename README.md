Getting Started with the Project

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
Run the following command to clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <https://github.com/tropnicates/trial>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the repository. You can find this URL on the GitHub page of the repository.

Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning, navigate into the project directory using the cd command:
bash
Copy code
cd assignment
Step 3: Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install the project dependencies using npm. Run the following command:
bash
Copy code
npm install
This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Step 4: Start the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:
bash
Copy code
npm start
This command will start the development server and automatically open the project in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Step 5: Explore the Project

Once the project is running, you can explore the application in your browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger a hot reload, meaning the changes will be reflected in the browser without needing to restart the server.
